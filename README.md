# Personal-Finance-Tracker

## Project Proposal

#### Motivation

In the modern age where there are countless ways that businesses are trying to encourage unnecessary spending, it is more important now than ever before for people to be equipped with the tools necessary to manage their finances. Currently there are various tools available to track personal finances but most of them are on a for-profit driven model, which require users to make one-time or recurring purchases to use the product. [1] These types of solutions are not ideal for mass adoption and to really help the most number of people improve their finances a free tool must be developed.

This is why a Rust crate would make the most sense since they are freely available and can easily be installed and used on most operating systems. The other benefit of using Rust is that Rust removes entire classes of errors such as dangling pointers, double free errors, and null pointer dereferences. However a key limitation of existing Rust finance tracking apps is the lack of a GUI because current implementations are limited to command line and file based I/O. [2] This is where FinanceR will fill a gap in the current ecosystem. FinanceR will implement a simple to use and intuitive GUI that will allow this app to be used by as many people as possible.
